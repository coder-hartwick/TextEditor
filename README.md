<p>TextEditor is a very basic and simple Text Editor written in JavaFX. With it, you get the very basic functions that a text editor should be able to accomplish.</li>
<ul>
<li>Create files</li>
<li>Open files</li>
<li>Save files</li>
<li>Print files</li>
<li>Multiple file tabs</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no menu bar in this application. Why? Because that would be too much. There is only a toolbar with buttons and key combinations.</p>
<p>This project is still in development so there are still features that will be added, but it is in working condition in the main branch.</p>
<h2>About The Code</h2>
<p>This whole project has so far been written in JavaFX. It uses JavaFX 8.
<h2>About the Creator</h2>
<p>I am a recent high school graduate who is available at any time. If you need an application to be developed, contact me on github.</p>
